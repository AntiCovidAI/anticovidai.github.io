	<!--About Us-->
	<section class="wrapper align-center inner">
			<h2 class="green-highlight">
				Our Mission
			</h2>
			<div class="align-justify">
				<p>
					Our vision is to develop a smartphone app that can be used by everyone in the world to find out in
					seconds whether they have COVID-19. We are utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to
					identify patterns undetectable by humans from the unique respiratory signatures of lungs damaged by the
					virus. From extensive research, we believe we can achieve 85% or more accuracy and help control this
					pandemic!
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>We hope to create a near future with:</b><br>
					1. Billions of people at home confidently knowing they are not infected<br>
					2. Reduced burden on health care systems, equipped with technology to know who to treat first<br>
					3. Eliminated necessity of social distancing
				</p>

				<p>
					We believe low cost, early detection, which will allow society to pinpoint the locations of the virus, is the key to end the pandemic and necessity for lockdowns.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2 class="green-highlight">
				Why This Will Work
			</h2>

			<div class="align-justify">
				<p>
					Because COVID-19 affects the throat and lungs of patients, even in early stages, detecting it in early stages from breathing and coughing sounds is feasible. Through analysis of this data, artificial intelligence is able to detect the signatures of COVID-19, even without knowing the inner workings of the actual microbial changes causing it.<br><br>

					Faculty from Stanford University's Medical and Artificial Intelligence research wings have given us their support and are on our advisory board.<br><br>

					Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU, MIT, and Cambridge. Our differentiator is that we have already started gathering authentic data from hospitals under approved clinic study. We are propelled by a swarm of self-motivated and passionate student AI engineers from various institutions. We are growing in number and are driven to serve humanity with no expectation of financial reward.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2 class="green-highlight">
				What You Can Expect?
			</h2>
			<div class="align-justify">
				<p>
					We are working tirelessly to rapidly develop accurate AI algorithms and a smartphone app / website. We
					expect to have a prototype by June and a production-grade system by August. Our app will keep improving
					weekly and will provide predictions of COVID-19 risk. We intend to deploy it globally, saving lives in
					developing countries, while also preparing the world to handle future pandemics and a potential
					re-appearance of COVID-19 in November.
				</p>

			<h2 class="green-highlight">
				Who We Are
			</h2>

			<div class="align-justify">
				<p>
					We are a passionate student-run team of AI engineers, mobile web app
					developers, and medical professionals. From our hearts, we want to do
					our best to help the situation and canâ€™t think of anything more noble.
					We are supported by faculty and professors at our universities.
